                <p>TL;DR Tim Hortons is building a best-in-class digital platform embedded into the daily lives of
                    Canadians. We’re looking for key hires across product, design and engineering to build a capable and

                <p>In 2021, the Tims Hortons app was one of the top 20 most used apps and the #1 Food and Drink app in
                    Canada ahead of competitors like Uber Eats, DoorDash and Skip the Dishes. We have over 4000
                    restaurants
                    across the country -meaning there is a Tims for every 10,000 Canadians - and the vast majority of
                    Canadians visit one of these locations every single month.</p>

                <p>If you’re Canadian you can probably remember a role that Tims has played in your life whether as a
                    first
                    job, an after practice donut or a haven on a long-road trip.</p>

                <p>Given our brand and scale, we believe we have an opportunity to create a platform to offer services
                    to
                    Canadians that extends well beyond our existing restaurant base. Our vision is to provide Canada
                    with a
                    digital ecosystem that delivers evolving forms of convenience, value, connection, and delight every
                    day.</p>

                <p>We’ve already started with in-app games like the NHL Hockey Challenge that has hundreds of thousands
                    of
                    daily active users but we have much further to go.</p>

                <p>To achieve these ambitions we know we need to build a best-in-class product, design, and engineering
                    organisation. We aren’t historically a tech company. We got where we are by making the best coffee
                    and
                    donuts and getting them to people fast. Not by writing code.</p>

                <p>Transformations like this are hard. There are few examples of traditional companies that have
                    developed
                    great tech capabilities but it does happen. We think it’s a worthwhile challenge and we have full
                    support from our company’s senior leadership to make the changes and create the needed culture.</p>

                <p>We’re now looking for the first hires to form the foundation of a team that can make this a reality
                    across engineering, product and design.</p>

                <p>If you are excited by building a rigorous, creative and effective engineering organisation and want
                    to
                    work at Canada’s most loved brand to make products that will be used by millions of Canadians then
                    reach
                    out.</p>
