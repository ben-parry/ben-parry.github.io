majority of this Christmas season<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. I'm just now starting to recover, though, it's slow going. Being ill at a time reserved for gratitude for the past year, reflection on what matters most, and optimism for  what lies ahead is a humbling experience. As has been said &#8220;A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.&#8221;<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>A little humility though is no bad thing. Every day we are surrounded by a wide array of tasks, pleasures, and problems. All these goings on can be equal parts fun or stressful, as the case may have it. Yet no matter they almost invariably manage to fit  snugly within our standard frame. We easily assign them to views we already hold about what is good, what is bad, how to be happy, how to &#8216;win&#8217;. They become part of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCbGM4mqEVw\">the water we swim in</a>. When one is humbled it <a href=\"https://benparry.substack.com/p/the-transformative-power-of-tragedy\">creates the space</a> to look at the world afresh. An opportunity to be graced with a new view.</p><p>From this angle humility is a kind of deference. Rather than relating to the world based on <em>our</em> views, and <em>our</em> experiences, humility gives us a chance to defer to the world as it appears in itself. Rather than imposing our map we defer to the territory in front of us. </p><p>Such a posture is a source of insight and strength. Insight because through deferring to something beyond ourselves we gain access to new ways of seeing the world. Strength because the recognition of our weakness allows us to understand what we are capable of. Such an understanding in turn brings control. Meekness, the state of being humble, is the translation in the Bible for the Greek word \"praus&#8221;, which literally means to be tame. Strength under control.</p><p>My illness also made me think a lot about courage. When I am ill, more than at any other time, I am likely to give in to the voice of discouragement: &#8220;I'm too tired to write anything.&#8221;, &#8220;I shouldn't read that book. I&#8217;m sick. Let&#8217;s just watch TV instead.&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get back to my friends when I&#8217;m feeling better<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a>.&#8221;, &#8220;Prayer would be too hard right now, I'll wait until I'm healthy.&#8221;.</p><p>Of course, part of this is because it&#8217;s true. When you're sick you really do need to rest and let go of your normal routine to some degree. Yet it is also a convenient excuse. Being sick is scary and difficult. You are in pain and you have lost at least some of your normal control of your body. You may suspect you will recover, but you don't know when or even if you will for sure. It is in these circumstances, when the future is uncertain and you are unsure of your own ability to meet what it has to bring, that courage is most necessary. Sickness is a testing ground for the spirit. An opportunity to boldly meet a challenge that lies at, or beyond, the edge of one's competence. </p><p>At first these two virtues, humility and courage, seem at odds but I think they are in fact close bedfellows. They are two sides of the same coin. </p><p>One way to illustrate this is through thinking about the strange dual origin of the Western tradition in Athens and Jerusalem. For Aristotle, in Athens, courage was the queen of the virtues. Courage gave you the fortitude to pursue everything else. For the Christian gloss on the Jewish tradition, born out of Jerusalem, humility played a similar role<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a>. Without the appropriate deference to God implied in humility one would could never be properly oriented in every other regard. </p><p>This admixture is perhaps why for most of its history that tradition has been so adamant about the importance of faith - the middle way between the humility to defer to what is and the courage to pursue what one must.</p><h3>2023 Year in review</h3><p>This year I didn't make any public goals I still however had a number of private ambitions. I can&#8217;t concretely point to some landmark accomplishment that I achieved but I can say that I made progress. </p><p>The most important personal calling for me was continuing on a journey towards Mandarin fluency. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll write more about it in future but for now suffice to say I studied Mandarin in university though I never made it very far towards fluent conversation, reading, or writing. This year I decided that I was going to change that and give it my best shot to pick the language up properly. </p><p>It felt like I spent the first 6 months of this endeavour floundering. I followed the learning methods that I had practiced in university and ended up mostly banging my head against the wall. About halfway through the year though I discovered ideas around '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis\">comprehensible input</a>&#8217; and learning through imitating the process that a child follows. I suddenly started to make progress. I'm still far away from my goals and the better I get the higher my goals become but it does feel like I'm finally moving in the right direction. More to come this year.</p><p>It's also not quite true that I didn't make <em>any</em> public goals. I thought that was the case until I was preparing for this letter and I came across this line from last year's letter:</p><blockquote><p>This year, I&#8217;ll send out an essay with a set of interesting links every Saturday morning Eastern time.</p><p>As evidenced above I have &#8216;committed&#8217; to writing here in 2021 and 2022 without the best results but with any luck the third time&#8217;s the charm. I know better now than I did then what a real commitment looks like. So, I believe I can stick with this.</p></blockquote><p>That's embarrassing. Somewhere along the way I simply forgot what I had said and stopped posting on a weekly basis. Despite this though it was still a good year. I maintained a pretty regular stream of essays:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png\" width=\"604\" height=\"230\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:230,&quot;width&quot;:604,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1114,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOPX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fddd06ab3-4871-4685-9752-a315fefc24b4_604x230.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In total 22 essays or ~4 per quarter.</p><p>I was also happy with the quality I was able to put out.

I look forward to many more years together:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic\" width=\"486\" height=\"507.69642857142856\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1521,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:486,&quot;bytes&quot;:465419,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8bQS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91c7a48e-484f-4f8f-b47f-324887ab557f.heic 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><button tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\"><svg role=\"img\" style=\"height:20px;width:20px\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title><path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Looking Forward to 2024 </h3><p>I've made a commitment to post essays here on a regular schedule for three years in a row and failed to do so every time. So, today I'm figuratively throwing in the towel on that aim.</p><p>At points in the past I've dabbled with the idea that I might want to convert this newsletter into a paid subscription. To do that some kind of regular content would be essential. Instead though I can now see that the most important thing for me here is to just keep writing about the topics I'm most interested in without any specific theme or schedule. I don't think I can do justice to that aim if I have a content schedule or paid audience to think about. </p><p>Writing in a more full-time capacity and creating something worth being paid for is still a vision for me but if it happens it will not be part of this newsletter but instead some kind of separate future project.</p><p>You can still expect regular posts here in 2024. If I had to guess, based on past years, it will average out to about once a month but there will undoubtedly be slow periods and bursts of activity.</p><p>In a different vein I think it's likely that I will pick back up work on The Volition Podcast. I have no set plans but I have one interview recorded and ready to release and a couple other potential guests in the pipeline so I&#8217;m confident there is something there.</p><p>I want above all for this year to be filled with peace and optimism. The world is large and beautiful and filled with opportunity. If you&#8217;re reading this I hope that you and I have many opportunities in 2024 to participate in it to the full.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2
